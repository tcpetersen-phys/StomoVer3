The xyz files contain the x, y and z cooridnates of each reconstructed point in units of pixels.  The format is a litt-endian 32-bit binary file of contiguous bits, with no header or footer, of the list x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 ...... xN, yN, zN, where N is the total number of points in the reconstruction.  This number N varies for each reconstruction and can be deduced from the file sizes as #bytes/4/3 or #bits/32/3, as there are three coordinates for each position vector.
